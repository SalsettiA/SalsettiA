- 👋 Hi, I’m @SalsettiA
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, finance and travelling
- 🌱 I’m currently keeping my skills up to date to understand the difficulties that my teams are facing daily.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I haven't decided to invest myself in an existing project, but I'm sharing small programs that I wrote for fun in my private time.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Look on internet to find out my full name and e-mail address or LinkedIn.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started computer science all along with books, when I was 12 on a C64. Then I leart, still alone: Pascal and Delphi. At the university, I studied with Oberon, Algol, Modula 2, ASM for HC11, Matlab, Java, C/C++ and Prolong. On the job, I worked intensively with TACL, Cobol, TAL, Perl, SQL/ P/L SQL. Still in private, I did experiments on OpenMP, OpenMPI, RPC, Go and Rust.
- Computer science is not all my life, when the weather is sunny, I ride my motorcycle and create short videos on Youtube to share what I see.
